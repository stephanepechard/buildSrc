# Kotlin `buildSrc` directory for Gradle Dependency Management

Android `buildSrc` directory to include dependencies to gradle files, see [Kotlin + buildSrc for Better Gradle Dependency Management](https://handstandsam.com/2018/02/11/kotlin-buildsrc-for-better-gradle-dependency-management/) for more details.

This directory is globally mine and tries to stick to last versions of each dependency. Feel free to propose new libs through Pull requests. You do not have to use all of these dependencies so the overhead of including a huge list is minimal.
